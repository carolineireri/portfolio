            <P>I am fun loving girl that was born and raised in Kenya. I have undergone the normal Kenya curriculum of the 8-4-4 system. Recently, I concluded my undergraduate degree and hopefully I get to graduate by the end of the year.
                  One of the best experiences I have had in my career path was a chance to undertake my attachment programme at N.H.I.F. The experience equiped me with alot of skills and I got a feel of how the job market is.
                  During my holiday breaks in campus, I did alot of sales and marketing jobs where I also learnt alot from the entrepreneurship and business world. 
                    Currently, I applied to a programming course at Moringa School.However, I am hopeful that I will learn how to code the right way and continue striving until I achieve my goals.
