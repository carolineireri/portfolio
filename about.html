            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <P>I am fun loving girl that was born and raised in Kenya. I have undergone the normal Kenya cirriculum of the 8-4-4 system. Recently, I concluded my undergraduate degree and hopefully I get to graduate by the end of the year.
                  One of the best experiences I have had in my career path was a chance to undertake my attachment programme at N.H.I.F. The experience equiped me with alot of skills and I got a feel of how the job market is.
                  During my holiday breaks in campus, I did alot of sales and marketing jobs where I also learnt alot from the entrepreneurship and business world. 
            </P>
            <p> Currently, I applied to a programming course at Moringa School. It has been a tough journey learning how to code by myself back in university. However, I am hopeful that I will learn how to code the right way and continue striving until I achieve my goals.
            </p>
            <p>In my social life, I love:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watching movies and documentaries.</li>
                    <li>Travelling.</li>
                    <li>Socializing.</li>
                    <li>Taking long walks with dogs.</li>
                </ul>
